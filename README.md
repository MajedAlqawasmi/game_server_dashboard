## Project Description
This data foundation is to be used to create a Tableau dashboard, which is intended to be used to gain deeper insights into company KPIs and customer transactions so that decisions can be made on this knowledge. The dashboard is to be used as a self-service tool to answer teams' own questions. 

## Data
The data is not real data. However, the structure of the data is based on a real scenario.

## About The Dashboard
Consisting of three partitions each coded with a certain color, this dashboard can serve as a self-service product for a broad audience of different teams. The partitions are:

- **Financial (Revenue)**
- **Services (Transactions)**
- **Customer Analytics (RFM customer segmentation, churn, customer life span and worth)**
